The Triad Puzzle
================

Spawned from concepts learned while going through [The Advancing Guitarist][TAG] by
Mick Goodrick, and a technique I've been using to navigate the fretboard in both
chord- and solo-context.

This is the development repository - codewise, I use [Less][LESS] and
[CoffeeScript][COFFEE]. I have [CodeKit][CK] doing the compiles and build into a
`build/` directory which is then published to the `gh-pages` branch - that branch is
served with [GitHub Pages][GH] at https://triad-puzzle.com

Currently, you get a sheet with 8 random triads and when you've played through them,
hit the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key (or tap any of the pieces if you're on a touch-enabled
device) to get a new sheet.

Concepts
--------

Most musicians know this (either because they know theory or because they've played a
lot and gradually arrived at the same conclusions :-) - but here's a basic rundown of
what I'm doing with this:

A **triad** is a chord that consist of three notes: _Root_, _third_ and _fifth_.
Depending on the intervals between those, the triad has a different symbol/name,
e.g., if you stack the notes _C_, _E_ and _G_, you have what's called a **C major
triad** and its symbol is just a `C`. If you lower the third (E) a half step to Eb
(which is pronounced "E-flat"), the chord becomes a **C minor triad**, which has the
symbol `Cm`.

Similarly, there is a **C diminished triad** and a **C augmented triad** with the
symbols `Cdim` and `C+`.

That's all well and good for learning them in the key of C, but there are 11 other
notes we could start on. For instance, starting just a half-step higher, these four
triads would be named after their new root, `C#` (pronounced "C sharp" - yep üòÅ) -
so: `C#`, `C#m`, `C#dim` & `C#+`.

Formulae
--------

In order to learn the triads in any key, it's great to learn the _formula_ (or recipe)
for any given one, expressed in the steps within the octave, so here's how I see them:

| Triad      | Symbol  | Formula |
|------------|---------|---------|
|major       |         | 1  3  5 |
|minor       | m       | 1 b3  5 |
|diminished  | dim     | 1 b3 b5 |
|augmented   | +       | 1  3 #5 |


Non-triads
----------

After doing this for quite some time, I started seeing other combinations that
wasn't real triads *per se*, but nevertheless great-sounding alternatives for the
standard ones. Their recipes are:

| Symbol  | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| sus2    | 1  2  5 |
| sus4    | 1  4  5 |
| add9    | 2  3  5 |
| m(add9) | 2 b3  5 |


The app will pick 8 random triads and shows their symbols on a sheet, so you can
practice playing them and most importantly, learn to move between any two in the
smoothest possible way.
